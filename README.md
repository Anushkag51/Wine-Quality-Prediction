# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Using data and analytics to predict the quality of wine based on given features, best accuracy achieved is 92.48%.
# Description
# Problem Statement
Wine is consumed by almost everyone nowdays. It has become part of one's culture to consume wine. Hence it is very important to analyze the quality of wine that is consumed by such large population. However, quality of wine is tested by humans through tasting. But wine contains physicochemicals that affect its taste and also this process is slow. So, in this project I have utilized the machine learning for doing the same. 
# Dataset
For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol
# Objective
To test various classification techniques and determine which produces the best accuracy and to ascertain the characteristics that most strongly suggest a high-quality wine
# Steps included
