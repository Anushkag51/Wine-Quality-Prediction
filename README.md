# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Using data and analytics to predict the quality of wine based on given features, best accuracy achieved is 92.48%.
# Description
# Problem Statement
Wine is consumed by almost everyone nowdays. It has become part of one's culture to consume wine. Hence it is very important to analyze the quality of wine that is consumed by such large population. However, quality of wine is tested by humans through tasting. But wine contains physicochemicals that affect its taste and also this process is slow. So, in this project I have utilized the machine learning for doing the same.
